<h3>What is SLAM?</h3>
<br>
<table width=500>

SLAM is the abbreviation for Simultaneous Localization And Mapping.

<br><br>

Mapping is the problem of integrating the information gathered with
the robot's sensors into a given representation. It can be described
by the question ``What does the world look like?''  Central aspects in
mapping are the representation of the environment and the
interpretation of sensor data.  In contrast to this, localization is
the problem of estimating the pose of the robot relative to a map. In
other words, the robot has to answer the question, ``Where am I?''
Typically, one distinguishes between pose tracking, where the initial
pose of the vehicle is known, and global localization, in which no a
priori knowledge about the starting position is given.  

<br><br>

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is therefore defined as
the problem of building a map while at the same time localizing the
robot within that map.  In practice, these two problems cannot be
solved independently of each other.  Before a robot can answer the
question of what the environment looks like given a set of
observations, it needs to know from which locations these observations
have been made.  At the same time, it is hard to estimate the current
position of a vehicle without a map.  Therefore, SLAM is often
referred to as a chicken and egg problem: A good map is needed for
localization while an accurate pose estimate is needed to build a map.
