	This software package implements a filtering technique that
	maintains a tractable approximation of the belief state as a
	thin junction tree. The junction tree grows under filter
	updates and is periodically ``thinned'' via efficient maximum
	likelihood projections so inference remains tractable. When
	applied to the SLAM problem, these thin junction tree filters
	have a linear-space belief state and a linear-time filtering
	operation. Further approximation yields a filtering operation
	that is often constant-time.

<br> <b>Long Description</b><br>
  
	Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental
	problem in mobile robotics: while a robot navigates in an
	unknown environment, it must incrementally build a map of its
	surroundings and, at the same time, localize itself within
	that map. One popular solution is to treat SLAM as an
	estimation problem and apply the Kalman filter; this approach
	is elegant, but it does not scale well: the size of the belief
	state and the time complexity of the filter update both grow
	quadratically in the number of landmarks in the map. This
	paper presents a filtering technique that maintains a
	tractable approximation of the belief state as a thin junction
	tree. The junction tree grows under filter updates and is
	periodically ``thinned'' via efficient maximum likelihood
	projections so inference remains tractable. When applied to
	the SLAM problem, these thin junction tree filters have a
	linear-space belief state and a linear-time filtering
	operation. Further approximation yields a filtering operation
	that is often constant-time. Experiments on a suite of SLAM
	problems validate the approach.

<b>Further Information</b><br>
 
	While I was writing it, I made every attempt to document the
	code and to design it in a modular and extensible
	fashion. However, I have not had time to make the code fully
	presentable; for example, there is no manual. Thus, this code
	will probably be useful only to people that are willing to
	spend a decent amount of effort. I do think that the design of
	the library is easily understood from the documentation, and I
	think it could be very helpful to others that would like to
	code up SLAM algorithms. I spent a lot of time on object
	design.<br><br>

	The code comes in two parts:<br><br>

	1. A Java library. This library contains an implementation of
	the thin junction tree filter (specialized for SLAM), as well
	as the Kalman and Information filters. To see what's included,
	you can browse the documentation.  <br><br>

	2. A Matlab interface to the Java library. This interface
	includes code to create SLAM simulations, run filters, and to
	visualize and analyze the results. To get a brief idea of
	what's included, you can check out the README.txt file.<br><br>

        I found this mixture of Java and Matlab to be very nice for
        prototyping, because you get the speed of Java, and the
        scripting and visualization of Matlab. To learn more about
        this, see the Matlab documentation.<br><br>

        This code is not supported, although I am happy to answer
        questions via e-mail. Furthermore, I do not plan to extend
        this code; I am currently working on a new implementation of
        the algorithms in Common Lisp, which has an object model that
        is far more flexible than that of Java.<br><br>

        Acknowledgements. This code uses (and includes) the JAMA Java
        matrix package. Some of the routines that count floating-point
        operations were adapted from routines in T. Minka's Lightspeed
        Matlab library. The Matlab library includes Niclas Borlin's
        implementation of the Hungarian algorithm, which is used for
        data association.
