<center><h2>Bayesian range-only SLAM (RO-SLAM) with SOGs</h2></center><center><table width=700> <tr><tr><td colspan=2>

     This is a C++ implementation for generic RBPF-SLAM with different kinds of maps, including one solution 
	 to Range-Only SLAM (RO-SLAM) with landmark maps represented as Sum of Gaussians (SOGs), which are dynamically 
	 adapted to represent well the uncertainty of all mapped beacons. There exists a stand-alone executable ready for use 
	 and demo configuration files and datasets.

<br> <b>Long Description</b><br>
  
    This solution to Range-Only SLAM (RO-SLAM) addresses the Bayesian inference problem of sequentially 
	tracking a vehicle while estimating the location of a set of beacons without any prior information. 
	The only assumptions are the availability of odometry and a range sensor able of identifying the 
	different beacons (i.e. no need to solve data association).<br><br>

    We exploit the conditional independence between each beacon distribution within a Rao-Blackwellized 
	Particle Filter (RBPF) for maintaining independent Sum of Gaussians (SOGs) for each map element in 
	Euclidean coordinates.<br><br>

	It is shown then that a proper probabilistic observation model can be derived for online operation 
	with no need for delayed initializations. This solution is far more accurate and efficient than a previous 
	implementation with beacons modeled with a Monte-Carlo approximation.

    Pairs of action (movements from odometry) + observation (sensed ranges to a set of static beacons).

<br> <b>Logfile Format</b><br>  
    A binary format called "Rawlog", suitable to laser or RGB+D scans, images, UWB beacons, 2D or 3D odometry, etc. 
	See its specifications: http://www.mrpt.org/Rawlog_Format
	These files can be visualized and manipulated with RawLogViewer or rawlog-edit. Both programs come in precompiled versions of MRPT and can be also found in the official Debian and Ubuntu repositories.

<br> <b> Hardware/Software Requirements</b><br> 

     The implementation is part of the C++ library: http://reference.mrpt.org/stable/group__mrpt__slam__grp.html 
	within the Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT). Built and tested on Windows/Linux, with Visual Studio 2008+/GCC 4.1+. 
	Requires: Eigen 3, but will use an included version if no system version is found. wxWidgets (optional, for GUI only)
