	 This package is a collection of implemented SLAM approaches
         by Tim Bailey. The code is written in MatLab and performs EFK,
         UKF, FastSLAM 1, and FastSLAM2.

<br> <b>Long Description</b><br>
  
	These MatLab simulations are of EKF-SLAM, FastSLAM 1.0,
	FastSLAM 2.0 and UKF-SLAM. The intent of these simulators was
	to permit comparison of the different map building
	algorithms. However, they might also be useful to the wider
	research community interested in SLAM, as a straight-forward
	implementation of the algorithms.<br><br>

	EKF-SLAM version 1. This older version of the EKF-SLAM
	simulator is probably easier to understand than the 2nd
	version, as it avoids using global variables.<br><br>

	EKF-SLAM version 2. This version of the EKF-SLAM simulator
	runs much faster in MatLab as it avoids copying overhead by
	using global variables. It also comes with an alternative
	observation model that can replace the 'update' function in
	'ekfslam_sim.m'. This alternative is a "global constraint"
	model devised by Jose Guivant, and may have better
	linearisation properties than the conventional range-bearing
	model.<br><br>

	FastSLAM 1.0 and 2.0. This implementation is slow in Matlab
	due to the overhead of looping constructs etc. However, it can
	give a good idea of how each algorithm works, and may serve as
	a starting point for more efficient implementations.<br><br>

	UKF-SLAM. This simulator is a direct adaptation of the
	EKF-SLAM code, but replaces the EKF with an unscented Kalman
	filter (UKF). To run this code you must first install MatLab
	utilities.
