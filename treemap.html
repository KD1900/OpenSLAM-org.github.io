	  Treemap is an algorithm for feature based Gaussian
	  SLAM. Actually it is an algorithm for incremental
	  probabilistic inference in a high dimensional Gaussian
	  defined as the product of many low dimensional Gaussians
	  (incremental least square). Treemap can handle different
	  variants of SLAM. Everything, that's specific to a SLAM
	  variant or even to SLAM as a problem is contained in a small
	  driver layer that can be adapted by the user.<br><br>

<br> <b>Long Description</b><br>
  
          The main contribution of treemap is extremely efficient
          Gaussian inference. For instance, it can compute a
          full probabilistic update on a map with 1032271 2D features
          in 442ms. So, to put it in a nutshell: Treemap does the same
          job as Levenberg-Marquardt, only much faster.<br><br>

	  The treemap algorithm as well as this implementation
	  consists of two layers. The treemap backend contains nearly
	  all the difficulties of the algorithm. It performs inference
	  in a high dimensional Gaussian defined as the product of
	  many low-dimensional Gaussians. The low-dimensional
	  Gaussians correspond to measurements. The second layer, the
	  treemap driver converts the original measurements into these
	  low dimensional Gaussians, basically by linearizing the
	  measurement equations and passes them to the treemap
	  backend. It also defines some application dependent
	  approximation policy. The backend then incrementally
	  computes the mean of the resulting Gaussian, which is in
	  turn converted by the treemap driver into a map estimate. We
	  have implemented drivers for 2D feature based SLAM, 2D/3DOF
	  pose relation based SLAM and 3D/6DOF feature based SLAM
	  without odometry.<br><br>

          So, as a user, you have to provide a set of measurements as
          a vector of real numbers, i.e. you have to do your own
          feature detection on the raw sensor data. And you have to
          provide the identity of features to which the measurements
          refer (data-association). You also have to provide
          covariance (uncertainties) for these measurements. This is
          often a hand tuned parameter. If you are doing one of the
          above mentioned SLAM variants, that's it. Otherwise you also
          have to implement your own driver that linearizes
          measurement equations and defines an approximation policy
          for the back-end.<br><br>

          Treemap provides a map estimate. It could in principle
          provide covariance information which would be useful for
          data-association. However, this is not implemented yet.

<br> <b>Input Data </b><br>  
	  The input to treemap are measurements with covariance and
	  known data-association. For 2D feature SLAM the input is the
	  observed 2D position of the feature relative to the robot, a
	  covariance (uncertainty) of that position and the id of the
	  feature observed. Additionally for every step of the robot
	  the 2D/3DOF pose of the robot after the step relative to the
	  pose before the step must be given with covariance. For 2D
	  pose relation based SLAM, a graph of 2D/3DOF poses is given,
	  where each node corresponds to the pose of the robot at some
	  point of time and an edge defines a measurement for one pose
	  relative to another pose obtained from scan-matching or
	  odometry. For 3D/6DOF SLAM the input is a 3D feature
	  position relative to the robot with the identity of the
	  feature. The current driver for 3D SLAM does not incorporate
	  inertial data or any form of odometry.

<br> <b> Hardware/Software Requirements</b><br> 

	  The code is entirely written in C++. It has been checked to
          compile with GCC 4.1.2. CMake is needed as a build tool,
          LAPACK for numerical computation, and gfortran for linking
          the LAPACK package.

<b>Further Information</b><br>
 
           The code contains a simulator for extremely large 2D SLAM
           datasets that have a more realistic topology than mowing
           the lawn. This may have an interest of its own.
